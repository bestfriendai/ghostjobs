Stop wasting your time on ghost jobs and scam postings. GhostJobs uses AI to analyze job listings and detect which ones are likely fake, expired, or never existed.

## Features

**🔍 Job Scanner**
Paste any job posting URL and get an instant ghost score. Our AI analyzes dozens of signals including posting date, company info, and job details.

**📊 Ghost Score**
Every job gets a ghost score from 0-100%. High score = high probability it's a ghost job. Make informed decisions about where to spend your time.
