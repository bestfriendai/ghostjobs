# Market Research: GhostJobs

## Market Size

The job search market is massive and growing:
- **Global HR technology market**: $200B+ (2024)
- **Job board revenue**: $12B+ annually
- **Active job seekers in US**: 6M+ monthly
- **Average time job search**: 5-6 months

## The Problem

**Ghost jobs** are a massive problem in the job market:
- Indeed estimates 50-60% of job postings are ghost jobs (never filled or never existed)
- LinkedIn has similar issues with "zombie" listings
- Job seekers waste 20+ hours per week on fake postings
- Total time wasted annually: billions of hours

## User Pain Points

1. **Time waste** - Applying to jobs that never get responses
2. **Scams** - Fake job postings used to collect personal info
3. **Discouragement** - Ghost jobs cause job seekers to give up
4. **No transparency** - Can't tell real from fake
5. **Manual research** - Have to research each company manually

## Opportunity

- Job seekers have no tool to verify job legitimacy
- Current solutions are manual (searching Reddit, company reviews)
- AI makes automated detection feasible
- Browser extensions create seamless integration

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Active job seekers (employed or unemployed)
- **Secondary**: Career changers, recent graduates
- **Tertiary**: Recruiters wanting to verify job postings

## Pricing Model

Freemium model works well:
- **Free**: 5 scans/day, basic features
- **Premium** ($4.99/mo or $29.99/yr): Unlimited scans, browser extension, history
