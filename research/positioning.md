# Positioning: GhostJobs

## Value Proposition

**For every job seeker who wants to stop wasting time on fake job postings, GhostJobs is a mobile app that provides AI-powered ghost job detection, because our algorithm analyzes posting signals to identify likely ghost jobs.**

## Problem We Solve

Job seekers apply to dozens of jobs, only to never hear back. Many of these "jobs" were never real - they're ghost jobs. Users waste hours on fake postings, get discouraged, and lose motivation.

## Solution

GhostJobs gives every job seeker a tool to verify job legitimacy before applying. Just paste a URL, get a ghost score, and make an informed decision.

## Differentiation

We're the **only** mobile app specifically designed to detect ghost jobs. While Indeed and LinkedIn host ghost jobs, we help users avoid them.

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Active job seekers aged 22-55 who use job boards like Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter

**Pain**: Wasting time on fake job postings
**Behavior**: Searches multiple job boards daily
**Motivation**: Wants to maximize job search efficiency
