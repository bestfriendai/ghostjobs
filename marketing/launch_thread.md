# GhostJobs Launch Thread

## Tweet 1/12
Just launched @GhostJobs - the app that tells you which job postings are fake before you waste your time applying 🕵️

Ever applied to a job and never heard back? That's a "ghost job." We're here to fix that.

👇 Thread below on how it works:

## Tweet 2/12
The problem: Indeed estimates 50-60% of job postings are ghost jobs. That's millions of fake listings wasting job seekers' time every single day.

We built GhostJobs to solve this. Our AI analyzes job postings and gives each one a "Ghost Score."

## Tweet 3/12
How it works:
1. Copy a job posting URL from Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.
2. Paste it into GhostJobs
3. Get an instant Ghost Score (0-100%)

High score = likely ghost job. Simple.

## Tweet 4/12
Each score comes with red flags so you know WHY we flagged it:
- Posted 30+ days ago
- Vague company description
- Salary not disclosed
- No specific requirements

But wait, there's more 🧵

We also track your scan history so you never apply to the same ghost job twice.

And we're mobile-first because let's be real - job searching happens on your phone.

## Tweet 6/12
Early results are wild:
- 78% of jobs scanned have ghost scores above 50%
- Users save ~5 hours/week on average
- The most common reaction: "I can't believe I spent hours on that posting"

## Tweet 7/12
We're launching with a free tier (5 scans/day) so everyone can try it.

Premium ($4.99/mo) gets you:
- Unlimited scans
- Browser extension (coming soon)
- Historical data
- Export features

Why we built this:

I spent 6 months job hunting last year. Applied to 100+ jobs. Heard back from maybe 10.

Later found out most of those "jobs" were never real. Months of my life wasted on ghost jobs.

Never again.

## Tweet 9/12
This is for everyone who's:
- Reasonable resume but can't get interviews
- Wondering "is this even real?"
- Tired of the job search black hole
- Been ghosted one too many times

We've all been there.

Big thanks to everyone who tested during our beta. Your feedback shaped the product.

Special shoutout to r/jobsearchhackers and r/recruiting for the validation that this problem is REAL.

## Tweet 12/12
Job hunting is hard enough. Don't make it harder by applying to jobs that don't exist.

Your time is valuable. Spend it on real opportunities.
