**Post - Professional**
"Excited to share GhostJobs - the tool I wish I had during my job search.

The problem: 50-60% of job postings are ghost jobs. The solution: an AI that detects them.

After 6 months of job hunting and 100+ applications, I learned most of those 'jobs' were never real. That's months of my life I can't get back.

Now job seekers have a tool to verify job legitimacy before applying. Simple as paste URL, get score.

Thank you to everyone who tested during beta and helped shape the product."
