## For Immediate Release

**Introducing GhostJobs: The AI-Powered Tool That Detects Fake Job Postings**

GhostJobs launches today as the first mobile app specifically designed to help job seekers identify ghost jobs before wasting their time applying.

With Indeed estimating that 50-60% of job postings are ghost jobs (positions that are never filled, expired, or never existed), job seekers need a tool to separate real opportunities from fake listings.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: GhostJobs analyzes job postings using AI to identify likely ghost jobs
- **Ghost Score**: Every job receives a score from 0-100% indicating probability of being a ghost job
- **Red Flags**: Users see specific reasons why a job was flagged (old posting, vague description, no salary, etc.)
- **Scan History**: Track all scanned jobs to avoid applying to the same ghost job twice
- **Multi-Platform**: Works with Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and other job boards

## Quote

"Job seekers spend months applying to hundreds of jobs, only to be ghosted by positions that never existed," said the GhostJobs team. "We're here to fix that. GhostJobs helps users focus their energy on real opportunities."

## Availability

GhostJobs is available now on iOS and Android with a free tier (5 scans/day) and Premium subscription ($4.99/month or $29.99/year).
