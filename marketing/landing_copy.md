## Problem Section

### The Ghost Job Problem

You spend hours tailoring your resume, writing cover letters, and hitting "apply" — only to never hear back.

Here's why: **Indeed estimates 50-60% of job postings are ghost jobs** — fake, expired, or never-existed listings that waste your time.

- 6+ months average job search
- 100+ applications sent
- <10% response rate
- Hours wasted on fake postings

**Sound familiar?**
